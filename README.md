# An example Fastlane setup.
 
 
## We've got some lanes for: 

- [x] Uploading default metadata to iTunesConnect for a new app
- [x] Automatically taking screenshots and delivering them to iTC, via [Snapshot](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot)
- [x] Building the app and submitting to Crashlytics Beta
- [x] Building the app and submitting for review, to iTunesConnect
- [x] Waving your white flag, and hoping the Knights of Vale come a galloping over the hill

See all the lanes in the [fastfile](https://github.com/jonstoked/MonthsOfTheYear/blob/master/fastlane/Fastfile).
